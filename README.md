## Andrew Segre

I am a young, passionate Full Stack web developer utilizing a background in psychology to create a more innate user experience on the web. Recently graduated from the Full Stack UC Berkeley Extensions Coding Bootcamp, where I mastered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the ability to implement React.js, Node.js and many more extensions of JavaScript. Near the end of the course, I developed a knack for the backend side of web development to the point where I could build a fully functioning API with 6 end points from scratch in just a few hours. I mastered building SQL databases as well as noSQL databases using MongoDB and Mongoose.js. I am also proficient at working with a team through Github and Jira from the planning stages to the final debugging stage of a web application.
